    # The pyartnet library doesn't do correct time calculation, since it doesn't
    # account for the fact that:
    #   1) Computation takes time.
    #   2) There are other things running on the CPU, so task doesn't always get
    #      called at precisely the right time.
    # What we do instead is ask pyartnet to compute the fade with waits of 1/240
    # seconds in between each computation. Then, we do more accurate time
    # calculations in our library.
